######### Problem 1.1
#same problem as above, but output should have the student name and all the marks in the same line.
# Eg - Input - Student Name - Chitra, Mark1 1 55, Mark 2 67
#output -  Chitra's marks 55, 67

#creating seperate list for student name, mark1 and mark 2
student_mark1 = list()
student_mark2 = list()
student_name = list()

#initiating a for loop to get the values from user and append it to the respective lists.
#As the number of students are specified to be 3 in the question we shall set the range to be 3
for student in range (3) :
    name = input(f"Enter Student {student+1} Name : ")
    student_name.append(name)
    mark1 = int(input(f"Enter mark 1 of Student {student+1} : "))
    student_mark1.append(mark1)
    mark2 = int(input(f"Enter mark 2 of Student {student+1} : "))
    student_mark2.append(mark2)
    print(f"*"*20)

#printing as per given in the question
for x in range(0,3) :
    print(f"{student_name[x]}'s marks {student_mark1[x]},{student_mark2[x]}")
