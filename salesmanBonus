#Calculate the monthly salary for the phone salesman
#Base monthly pay Rs10000. 
#For every 5 phones sold, Rs 5000 bonus.
#For every phone aftr the first 5 phones, Rs1100 per phone bonus.
#If the salesman's salary is more than Rs20000 in the previous month and sells 20 or more phones 
# this month also, then he gets additional Rs5000.
